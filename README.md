# launchdee

launchdee is a simple and easy GUI for viewing, enabling and disabling macOS launch agents and login items. it is a frontend for launchctl and launchd.

## usage
first, install Python 3.9 or later. next, make sure you have dependencies `wxPython` and `pyobjc-framework-cocoa`: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
then just run main.py: `python3 main.py`
